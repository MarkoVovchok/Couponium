This is my frist project, made for college. 
It is a Full-Stack webapp, fully written by me, inspired by my teachers, javabrains YouTube channel, and kthulhu.
The core is Java build with Maven, and web part is Angular 1 with Javascript and a lot of tears. 
Minimal desing is provided by Bootstrap CSS.
